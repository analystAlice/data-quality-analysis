# Data Quality Analysis with R

This repository hosts a collection of `Jupyter Notebooks` and `R Notebooks` in both **English** and **Spanish**, dedicated to performing **data quality analysis** using the `R programming language`. A detailed analysis structure is provided, enabling thorough inspection and enhanced understanding of an **example dataset**. It's important to note that the dataset used is for illustrative purposes only and its practical relevance is limited; it is included solely to demonstrate data analysis methodologies and techniques. Additionally, the repository contains `HTML` versions of the notebooks and the resulting **images of the graphics**.

## Viewing and Editing Notebooks

The `Jupyter Notebooks` in this repository **can be viewed directly on GitHub**, which allows for easy review of the analysis and outcomes without the need for local execution. For an interactive experience or to modify the analysis, it is recommended to **clone the repository** and work with the notebooks locally.

If you wish to execute or edit the notebooks on your own machine, ensure you have an **R distribution installed**, along with the **packages mentioned in the notebooks**. Jupyter users will need to install `IRKernel` to enable the execution of `R` within this environment.
